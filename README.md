It is a simple game simulation (similar to “Packman”) that made using JavaFX. The game is started with a command-line argument representing the file that describes a specific map for the game.
The basic options of the player are:
Move within the map (table) in four directions: right, left, up, down;
Collect the food that appears in some region of the given map.

The game finishes when there is no more food to eat, and displays the total points.
